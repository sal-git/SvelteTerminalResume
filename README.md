# Svelte Terminal Resume

This is basically an interactive resume in a form of a termianl GUI.

It's also a small project to test the Svelte Framework...wait, compiler? I had originally wanted to do it in Vue.js, but stopped mid way through. The unfinished Vue.js project has close to double the amount of code that this project has!

## Credits

The CSS I used for this project is from [Fobab's ubuntu terminal](https://github.com/fobabs/ubuntu-terminal) with only a few modifications. Thank you!
